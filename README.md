# myLLM : ðŸ§ 

An intelligent character-level Hindi language model built with **PyTorch**. It learns Hindi patterns from text and generates meaningful Hindi sentences given a prompt.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack :
- Python
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Numpy

## ðŸŽ¯ Features : 
- Character-level LSTM architecture
- Custom Hindi text prompt generation
- Fully trainable and modifiable model
- Loss tracking and visualization with Matplotlib

## ðŸ“š Learning Outcomes :
- Deep understanding of RNNs and LSTMs for NLP
- Sequence modeling and character encoding
- Custom training loops and loss optimization
- Text generation using temperature sampling

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements :
- Integrate with Hugging Face Transformers for better pretraining
- Add word-level generation instead of character-level
- GUI interface for real-time input/output generation
- Deploy model as an API or web app using Flask/Streamlit

> Build your own custom LLM from scratch â€” no third-party models, just raw PyTorch and your creativity.
